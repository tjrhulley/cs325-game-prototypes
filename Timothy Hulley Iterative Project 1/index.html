<h2>Robber and Cop</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
You play both roles of a heist! First as the robber escaping police, then as the police officer chasing following your own trail.
It requires some fast reflexes and memorization to play!
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The game randomly decides where each obstacle will go, and also remembers the locations of each coin that is dropped. These locations are saved and accessed in arrays.

The scrolling background is also just an illusion. It's just a gif of the road moving while your car is stationary.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned a couple of minor things in this project. How to use arrays, create custom bounds, and how to manage groups of objects.
-The easiest part was randomly spawning cones and making sure the coins spawned correctly.
-The hardest part was getting the collision to work between the cones and the car, though that didn't take too long to adjust.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Prototype closely resembles other top down driving games like Spy Hunter and GTA. 
Uses code from the "Sprite Pool" and "Breakout" Phaser examples.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Fans of racing games, as well as fans of robbery/heist themed games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Given how short the timers are, game should only last for about a minute (assuming you don't want to try again for a better score).
</li>
