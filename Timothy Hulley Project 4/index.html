<h2>The Quicksand Hotel</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Nobody has ever tried building a hotel on top of quicksand before!
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
This is the first game project I've made using matter physics instead of arcade. It also features a level and background elements that dynamically sink into the ground.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
As I said above, the main thing I learned was how to use and configure matter physics objects, though really I feel like I've only scratched the surface of what they 
can do. Getting these objects to work properly was the hardest part of creating this project for me. The other thing I learned was how to implement a sprite sheet and 
create animations, which surprisingly was the easiest part of the project. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All of the art assets used were taken from various sources online. The winning and losing sounds were ripped from Super Punch Out and Mario Party.

<li>Character sprites: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/classic-hero">Old hero by GrafxKid</a></li>
<li>Luggage box: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/box-2">Box by Alekei</a></li>

<li>Hotel logo: <a href="https://www.makewordart.com/">Wordart generator</a></li>
<li>Win sound: Super Punch Out (Gabby Jay's "yay")</li>
<li>Lose sound: Mario Party (Wario's "oh my god!")</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This prototype uses the phaser "first game" example as a base, and is most similar to that and other 2d platformers.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
This is a game where you have to lift a heavy package up stairs while they are rapidly sinking into the ground.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Absurdist.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The game is a 2D platformer with standard controls: left and right to move, and up to jump. While not exactly random, the physics of the luggage (as well as the bounciness 
of it) can make it's movements hard to predict.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype is mainly evaluating matter physics objects and how they can be used in gameplay. It also evaluates time pressure situations.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to experience the tension of trying to solve a difficult task under time pressure. Players will try and try again until they have a consistant feel for 
how the box can be moved, and afterwards try to compete against each other for the fastest time.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Players take control of the bellhop as he tries to bring luggage to the room at the top of the stairs. The issue is that the only inputs they have are moving and jumping.
In order to move the box, all that needs to be done is to push it using your body. Whether it be launching it in the air or balancing it on your head, the player's main 
way of interacting with the box is by moving it with the bellhop's body. At the same time, the floor and stairs are slowly sinking down. If either the luggage or the player 
fall in, it's game over! To win, one must push the box to the door. Afterwards, they will be shown the time it took to finish the game, incentivizing them to try again.

Later game builds will feature more levels with different floor layouts and obsticles to get past in order to deliver the luggage. Players can also earn prizes and rewards 
for beating levels under a "par" time.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
There are a few different ways the box can be brought up the stairs. Players might try gently carrying it on their heads, pushing it up the stairs, or lifting it high 
and pushing it similar to a volley ball. Obviously players won't stick soley to one method if the box falls over, so being adaptable is key! At the same time, I image 
that if people play it enough they'll come up with a consistant way of beating the game on their own and try repeating that strategy until they get the best time they can.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Welcome to the Quicksand Hotel! A thrilling resort where guests can enjoy the excitement of slowly sinking into the earth with no way to stop it. 
It is the latest in the line of disaster themed establishments, including Earthquake Park and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgCH2zb-x_I">Club Tornado</a>.

As one of the bellhops, it is your job to bring luggage to the guestsâ€™ rooms before they have completely sunken in. 
Some of the guests are a bit cheeky though, putting their luggage in heavy wooden crates just to screw with you. 
Can you push it up the stairs in time, or will you soon realize why very few people actually work at the Quicksand Hotel?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Arcade game fans and quicksand enthusiasts.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
A round should only take less than a minute to play (that floor sinks fast!), but you can keep playing over and over again to get a better time.
