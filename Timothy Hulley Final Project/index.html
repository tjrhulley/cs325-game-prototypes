<h2>Dungeon Keyfence (Slightly less unfinished version)</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
It doesn't require a mouse to play. At its current state that's pretty much it.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
There's probably too many 2d arrays that are trying to keep track of everything. I also used a phaser function to create a grid of key sprites for the keyboard.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how difficult it is to make phaser projects without any good code or phaser example references.
</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Other tower defense games, as well as Plants vs Zombies.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A tower defense game based entirely on your keyboard.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Medieval, war.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The game is a turn based strategy/tower defense game. Input is entirely through the keyboard, with the number keys selecting units and letter keys placing them. 
Randomness is how enemies are spawned.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The idea with this prototype is to test turn based strategy gameplay as all my previous projects were more action themed (and some players experienced a glitch where those games ran too fast).
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to feel tension as enemies get closer and closer to their base while they scramble for their resources.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The goal is to protect your castle from the oncoming army. Pressing 1-0 will select a unit and pressing any other key on your keyboard will place it. Press enter to advance 
a turn, spawning new enemies and advancing them.
Game will eventually feature more units (including ones that move in the same way enemies do) and enemies with improved ai.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
When more units are added, the key strategy is using whatever you can to defend your base. It's all a balance between saving up your resources for more expensive units or 
spending them on cheaper units when you're in tight spots.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Enemies are invading a castle and you've narrowed them down to a narrow, keyboard shaped field. Stop em or you're dead!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Fans of turn based strategy games and tower defense games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Should only take a couple of minutes to play, depending on how you can (theoretically) defend your castle.
</li>
