Obsticles too add:
-Cars that swerve left or right.
-Oil slick obsticle that freezes your movement.
-Trash cans
-Deer that move left or right.

Add physics to car.
Make it so you can catch up to the car at the end of the cop's turn.
Add sound effects.
-Car driving sounds (maybe add sounds every time an object passes you)
-Police siren
-Crashing/exploding sound
-Dropped money sound
-Collected money sound
-Car gets away sound
Add explosion effects if the car hits an obsticle
Make the robber drive upward if they get away.
Improve hud.


Adjust difficult: Game's too hard. Increase velocity of car or decrease speed of cones
