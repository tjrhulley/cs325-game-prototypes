<h2>3Spooky</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
A blend of horror and arcade style gameplay. It's unique in that you have to memorize where enemies are going in order to both see and avoid them.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Starting the game causes a fade to black effect before your own field of vision is reduced.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
I learned how to use a variety of tools that phaser has to offer (masks, timer events, movements and velocity). The easiet part was creating the spotlight around 
the player's cursor. The hardest part was reworking the breakout demo and adding more things to it (hence the delay).
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
The ghost sprites were drawn by me. All other assets were taken elsewhere.
<ul>
<li>Breakout: <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/games/breakout/breakout">Ball movement</a></li>
<li>Get Bodies Within Circle: <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/physics/arcade/get-bodies-within-circle">Circle</a></li>
<li>Image Mask Multiple Circles: <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/display/masks/geometry-mask/image-mask-multiple-circles">Circle mask</a></li>
<li>Free Pixel Art Forest: <a href="https://edermunizz.itch.io/free-pixel-art-forest?download">Background</a></li>
<li>Various sounds from Freesound.org: <a href="https://freesound.org/">Sounds</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Most closely resembles Hide and Boo Seek minigame from New Super Mario Bros DS.
Borrows code from "Breakout", "Get Bodies Within Circle", and "Image Mask Multiple Circles" examples.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A game about avoiding tracking the movements of ghosts while avoiding seeing too many of them.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Horror.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input is done soley with mouse movement (clicking only to start the game). When the game starts, the movement speeds, direction, and positions of each enemy is 
randomized. The game's genre is an arcade horror.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Evaluating memorizing enemy movements when they cannot be easily seen.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players will feel tension as they try to avoid enemies and work towards getting a high score.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
</li>
